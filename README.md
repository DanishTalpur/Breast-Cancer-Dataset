## Breast Cancer Dataset - Sklearn/Kaggle Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) exploring the Breast Cancer dataset with scikit-learn. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

### Dataset Provenance
- Source: Kaggle â€” replace with the exact competition/dataset link once available.
- Link: <ADD_KAGGLE_LINK_HERE>
- File: `breast-cancer.csv`

### Project Contents
- `main.ipynb`: Analysis and modeling notebook.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset file from Kaggle.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies to reproduce the environment.
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python/Jupyter/OS ignores.
- `LICENSE`: MIT license.

### Getting Started
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `main.ipynb` and run the cells.

### Confusion Matrix
The notebook includes a confusion matrix to evaluate classifier performance.

Rendered matrix (exported from the notebook):

If the image is missing, open `main.ipynb`, run the evaluation section, and export/save the figure as `confusion_matrix.png` in the repository root.

### Notes
- Please update the Kaggle link above once you have it.
